# Opposition :crown: 
How many times have you lost a known draw position or blundered a known winning position :sob: ? You are not alone! Many new and even intermediate chess players go through the same thing. If you have never read a chess book or were never taught by a chess coach, and have been relying on your intuition this whole time, you have come to the right place. 

## Did you know ü§î
Chess is solved for 7 or less pieces on the board. There is a tablebase called **Endgame Tablebase**, a database consisting of all the possible endgame positions with 7 or less pieces on the board. Computer can exactly tell the outcome of a position for these positions. Does it mean that you need to remember the 18.4 Terabytes of data in order to be an endgame expert? The answer is, No üò∏. Turns out, learning the key fundamentals of the endgames and being able to identify such positions on the board when they occur is the easiest way to master endgames. King Opposition is one of the most important concepts for King-Pawn endgames and we are going to be talking about it today ‚ôüÔ∏è.

## What is Direct Opposition?
Direct Opposition is a position in which the kings are on the same rank or file and they are separated by one square. In such a situation, the player not having to move is said to "have the opposition". The side without the opposition may have to move the king away, **potentially allowing the opposing king access to important squares**.

Examples:

1) **White to play**

In this position, white has the opportunity to obtain the opposition due to a simple reason. White can control the e3 square, forcing the black king to step left or right, thereby, obtaining opposition. Since white has the opposition, the position is an easy draw because white can control the key squares and prevent the black king from ever bringing the king to d2 or f2 square (which is important in order for black to promote the pawn).

2) **White to play**

In this position, white has the opportunity to obtain the opposition by stepping in front of the c4 pawn, forcing black king to step left or right, thereby, obtaining opposition. White just needs to step in the opposite direction of black king and aim to bring the king to either d7 or b7 square (which is important in order for white to control the pawn). 

## What is Distant Opposition?
Distant Opposition is a position in which the kings are on the same rank or file but are separated by more than one square. If there are an odd number of squares between the kings, the player not having the move has the (distant) opposition.

Examples:
1) **White to play**

In this position, white and black kings are both on the same rank and it is black's turn. Since there are odd number of squares between black and white king, white has the opposition. White is able to control the key squares and thus, hold a draw.

2) **White to play**

In this position, white and black kings are both on the same rank and it is white's turn. There are even number of squares (six) between black and white king, but it is white to move. White can play Ke2 and reduce the number of squares to 5 and pass the turn to black. Remember, odd number of squares + black to play = white has opposition. Thus, white is able to control the squares and win the game.

## Key Takeaways
- In the King Pawn endgame, always aim to hold the opposition in order to maximize your drawing or winning chances
- If there are odd number of squares between Kings and it is white to play, black has the opposution (and vice versa üòô)
- If there is 1 square between Kings and it is white to play, black has the opposition (and vice versa üòÑ)
- The reason for taking the opposition is to control **key squares** so remember to use common sense as well
